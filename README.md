🚀 Excited to share my first project during my Data Analysis Using Python internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd!

#🔍 Project: Student Performance Analysis
Using the student-mat.csv dataset, I explored academic data to derive insights into student performance based on various factors such as study time, gender, and grades.

📌# Project Highlights:

✅ Loaded and inspected the dataset using Pandas.

🧹 Performed data cleaning by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

📊 Explored the dataset using functions like .isnull(), .dtypes, and .shape.

📈 Answered key analytical questions:

What is the average final grade (G3)?

How many students scored above 15 in G3?

Is there a correlation between study time and final grades?

Which gender has a higher average G3?

🔧 Tools & Skills Used:
Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis

This task gave me hands-on experience in data analysis and a deeper understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

Looking forward to diving into more projects ahead! 🚀📊
